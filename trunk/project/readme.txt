1. Ownership of folders is completely intuitive.  
You are not to work in a folder that is not yours.

assets - owned by client

design - owned by designers

develop - owned by developers

production - owned by project manager / producer / account manager

2. The only exception is that to send a file to anyone you place it in their _incoming folder.  You can create a new folder in there, dated, as you like it...

You must email the person to let them know, and name the file logically.


3. Anything that is delivered should be checked by production team.

Production team should retain a copy of this.  
It is important for legal reasons as well as process
